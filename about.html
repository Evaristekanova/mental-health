			<h3>history about Mental Health </h3>
			<p>
				The history of Mental Health America is the remarkable story of one person who turned a personal struggle with mental illness into a national movement
			and of the millions of others who came together to fulfill his vision.
			Around the turn of the twentieth century, Clifford W. Beers,
			a recent graduate of Yale College and a newly-minted Wall Street financier, suffered his first episode of bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness) following the illness and death of his brother. In the throes of his illness, Beers attempted to take his own life by jumping out a third story window. Seriously injured but
				still alive, Beers ended up in public and private hospitals in Connecticut for the next three years.
